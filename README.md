# V-Builder

Victory Builder is a Digimon Card Game deck builder.



## Missing files

All the card textures are missing in the `card_images` folder, these are copyrighted content from Bandai and Toei Animation. I can't provide those textures as I don't have the rights to redistribute them but you can find the *.import files so you can check which textures are missing.
